Review diffs for unnecessary complexity. One line per finding: location, what
to cut, what replaces it. The diff's best outcome is getting shorter.

## Ladder

Primary source: the ladder in `skills/ponytail/SKILL.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
Generated verbatim by `scripts/build-review-doctrine.js` — edit the source,
not this block, then re-run the generator.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED LADDER -->
## The ladder

Stop at the first rung that holds:

1. **Does this need to exist at all?** Speculative need = skip it, say so in one line. (YAGNI)
2. **Already in this codebase?** A helper, util, type, or pattern that already lives here → reuse it. Look before you write; re-implementing what's a few files over is the most common slop.
3. **Stdlib does it?** Use it.
4. **Native platform feature covers it?** `<input type="date">` over a picker lib, CSS over JS, DB constraint over app code.
5. **Already-installed dependency solves it?** Use it. Never add a new one for what a few lines can do.
6. **Can it be one line?** One line.
7. **Only then:** the minimum code that works.

The ladder is a reflex, not a research project — but it runs *after* you
understand the problem, not instead of it. Read the task and the code it
touches first, trace the real flow end to end, then climb. Two rungs work →
take the higher one and move on. The first lazy solution that works is the
right one — once you actually know what the change has to touch.

**Bug fix = root cause, not symptom.** A report names a symptom. Before you
edit, grep every caller of the function you're about to touch. The lazy fix IS
the root-cause fix: one guard in the shared function is a smaller diff than a
guard in every caller — and patching only the path the ticket names leaves
every sibling caller still broken. Fix it once, where all callers route through.

## Format

`L<line>: <tag> <what>. <replacement>.`, or `<file>:L<line>: ...` for
multi-file diffs.

Tags:

- `delete:` dead code, unused flexibility, speculative feature. Replacement: nothing.
- `stdlib:` hand-rolled thing the standard library ships. Name the function.
- `native:` dependency or code doing what the platform already does. Name the feature.
- `yagni:` abstraction with one implementation, config nobody sets, layer with one caller.
- `shrink:` same logic, fewer lines. Show the shorter form.

## Examples

❌ "This EmailValidator class might be more complex than necessary, have you
considered whether all these validation rules are needed at this stage?"

✅ `L12-38: stdlib: 27-line validator class. "@" in email, 1 line, real validation is the confirmation mail.`

✅ `L4: native: moment.js imported for one format call. Intl.DateTimeFormat, 0 deps.`

✅ `repo.py:L88: yagni: AbstractRepository with one implementation. Inline it until a second one exists.`

✅ `L52-71: delete: retry wrapper around an idempotent local call. Nothing replaces it.`

✅ `L30-44: shrink: manual loop builds dict. dict(zip(keys, values)), 1 line.`

## Scoring

End with the only metric that matters: `net: -<N> lines possible.`

If there is nothing to cut, say `Lean already. Ship.` and stop.

## Boundaries

Scope: over-engineering and complexity only. Correctness bugs, security holes,
and performance are explicitly out of scope. Route them to a normal review
pass, not this one. A single smoke test or `assert`-based
self-check is the ponytail minimum, not bloat, never flag it for deletion.
Does not apply the fixes, only lists them.
"stop ponytail-review" or "normal mode": revert to verbose review style.

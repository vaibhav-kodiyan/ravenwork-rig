You know him. Long ponytail. Oval glasses. Has been at the company longer than the version control. You show him fifty lines; he looks at them, says nothing, and replaces them with one.

Ponytail puts him inside your AI agent.

## Before / after

You ask for a date picker. Your agent installs flatpickr, writes a wrapper component, adds a stylesheet, and starts a discussion about timezones.

With ponytail:

```html
<!-- ponytail: browser has one -->
<input type="date">
```

More survivors in [examples/](examples/).

## Numbers

Five everyday tasks (email validator, debounce, CSV sum, countdown timer, rate limiter), three models, three arms: no skill, the [caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) skill, and ponytail. Ten runs per cell, median reported.

</p>

**80-94% less code, 47-77% less cost, and 3-6× faster than a no-skill agent, on every model.** Every shortcut ponytail takes is marked in the code with a `ponytail:` comment naming its upgrade path. Reproduce it yourself: `npx promptfoo eval -c benchmarks/promptfooconfig.yaml`. Method and raw numbers: [benchmarks/](benchmarks/). Production-grade tasks, where an unconstrained agent bloats far more, are written up in [benchmarks/results/](benchmarks/results/).

## How it works

Before writing code, the agent stops at the first rung that holds:

```
1. Does this need to exist?   → no: skip it (YAGNI)
2. Stdlib does it?            → use it
3. Native platform feature?   → use it
4. Installed dependency?      → use it
5. One line?                  → one line
6. Only then: the minimum that works
```

Lazy, not negligent: trust-boundary validation, data-loss handling, security, and accessibility are never on the chopping block.

## Install

The most effort ponytail will ever ask of you:

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add DietrichGebert/ponytail
/plugin install ponytail@ponytail
```

### Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add DietrichGebert/ponytail
codex
```

Open `/plugins`, select the Ponytail marketplace, and install Ponytail. Then
open `/hooks`, review and trust its two lifecycle hooks, and start a new thread.

### Pi agent harness

```
pi install git:github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail
```

### OpenCode

Run OpenCode from a checkout of this repo (the plugin reuses its `hooks/` and `skills/`), and add to `opencode.json`:

```json
{ "plugin": ["./.opencode/plugins/ponytail.mjs"] }
```

Injects the ruleset every turn at the active level; adds the `/ponytail` commands (see [Commands](#commands)). OpenCode also auto-loads this repo's `AGENTS.md`, so the rules hold even without the plugin. The plugin adds the `lite/full/ultra/off` levels.

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail
```

Loads the ruleset as always-on context every session and registers the `/ponytail` commands; the `skills/` ship too, activated when a task needs them.

That was it. He'd be proud. He won't say it.

Active every session, with a handful of commands (see [Commands](#commands)). `/ponytail ultra` exists for when the codebase has wronged you personally. Startup and mode-change text shows the current mode.

Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Copilot, Aider, Kiro: copy the matching rules file from this repo ([`.cursor/rules/`](.cursor/rules/), [`.windsurf/rules/`](.windsurf/rules/), [`.clinerules/`](.clinerules/), [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md), [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), [`.kiro/steering/`](.kiro/steering/)).

Kiro: copy `.kiro/steering/ponytail.md` to `~/.kiro/steering/` (global) or `.kiro/steering/` in your project.

GitHub Copilot CLI: it already reads `AGENTS.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in a project, or copy the rules into `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md` to run ponytail in every project.

Antigravity and VS Code with the Codex extension: both read `AGENTS.md`, which this repo ships, so it works from the repo root with no setup (`~/.codex/AGENTS.md` makes Codex global, `.agents/rules/` makes it an always-on rule in Antigravity).

Which files map to which agent: [Agent portability](docs/agent-portability.md).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/ponytail [lite \| full \| ultra \| off]` | Set the intensity, or turn it off. No argument reports the current level. |
| `/ponytail-review` | Review the current diff for over-engineering, hands back a delete-list. |
| `/ponytail-audit` | Audit the whole repo for over-engineering, not just the diff. |
| `/ponytail-debt` | Harvest the `ponytail:` shortcuts you've deferred into a ledger, so "later" doesn't become "never". |
| `/ponytail-help` | Quick reference for the commands above. |

Commands need a skill-capable host (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, pi). In Codex they're skills, invoke with `@` (`@ponytail-review`). The instruction-only adapters (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Copilot, Kiro, Antigravity) load the always-on ruleset without the commands.

## Development

When changing the compact rule text, keep the agent copies aligned:

```bash
node scripts/check-rule-copies.js
```

## FAQ

**Does it need a config file?**
No.

**What if I really need the 120-line cache class?**
You don't. Insist anyway and he'll build it. Slowly. Correctly. While looking at you.

**Does it scale?**
The code you never wrote scales infinitely. Zero bugs, zero CVEs, 100% uptime since forever.

**Why "ponytail"?**
You know exactly why.

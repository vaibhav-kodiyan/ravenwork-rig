# Rig

Rig is a curated, host-agnostic toolbox for coding agents. Tier 1 installs a
markdown-only workflow into any repository: one shared router, an always-on
Ponytail implementation rule, and focused skills for intent, design, execution,
TDD, debugging, and code review.

It starts no processes, needs no API keys, and installs no dependencies.

## Install Tier 1

From this checkout:

```sh
sh rig/bootstrap.sh --target /path/to/repository
```

The bootstrap prompts for the tier when run interactively. Automation can make
the same choice explicitly:

```sh
sh rig/bootstrap.sh --tier 1 --target /path/to/repository
```

Tier 1 installs the same instruction set for these host entrypoints:

- Claude Code gets project skills in `.claude/skills/` and a router pointer in
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- Codex gets native project skills in `.agents/skills/` plus the always-on
  router pointer in `AGENTS.md`.
- OpenCode, Antigravity, CodeWhale, Swival, and other `AGENTS.md` readers get a
  root pointer.
- Gemini CLI gets a `GEMINI.md` pointer.
- Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, and `.agents/rules` readers get
  their native project instruction files.

Every adapter reads `.rig/routing.md`. Claude and Codex also discover the same
seven skills natively from their host directories. Existing host entrypoints
are preserved.

Those native skill trees are committed in this repository at `.claude/skills/`
and `.agents/skills/`; the bootstrap copies them unchanged into target repos.

| Host | Installed entrypoint |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/skills/rig-*/SKILL.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/rig.mdc` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/rig.md` |
| Cline | `.clinerules/rig.md` |
| GitHub Copilot editor/CLI | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| Codex / VS Code Codex | `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/rig-*/SKILL.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` |
| Antigravity | `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/rules/rig.md` |
| Kiro | `.kiro/steering/rig.md` |
| OpenCode, CodeWhale, Swival | `AGENTS.md` |
| Other agents | Configure the host to read `.rig/routing.md`, or add the one-line pointer from `rig/tier-1/adapters/pointer.md` to its project instructions. |

## Curation Spine

| Phase | Rig owner |
|---|---|
| Intent and acceptance tests | Grilling |
| Product and technical design | Product design |
| Implementation | Ponytail |
| Execution and parallelism | Execution |
| TDD | Curated graft |
| Debugging | Curated graft |
| Code review | Curated graft |

The curated skills label their checks by workflow phase. They merge the
distinctive parts of each workflow instead of concatenating source documents.

## Tier 1 Boundary

Tier 1 is intentionally a dumb bootstrap with a fixed file list. It has no
manifest, parser, materializer, sync engine, runtime, keys, or `.env` handling.
The shared layout is predictable so a future Tier 2 can describe it without
changing the installed shape.

The workflow is advisory because Tier 1 ships markdown only. Claude and other
hook-capable hosts can provide real tool-boundary enforcement in a later tier;
Cursor cannot. Rig states that limitation instead of claiming prose is a hard
guardrail.

## Verify

```sh
npm run test:rig
```

The test bootstraps a fresh temporary repository and checks the complete shared
payload, every instruction adapter, preservation of existing host files, the
markdown-only boundary, and absence of secret placeholders.
